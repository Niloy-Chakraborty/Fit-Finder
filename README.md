# About
Personalized size and fit recommendations bear crucial significance for any fashion e-commerce platform.To avoid the busness loss due to unsatisfactory article returns, Collaborative models (which look at the previous orders, or similar orders) are not the best recommenders. What if, we could embedd customer features (their reviews and expectations) and the article features into a latent space and then give personalized recommendation? 
(Customer features can contain the preferences of what type of fitting the customers like, and Product's feature can capture properties, like article type, style or size.)

SFNET is a deep learning based architecture (by Zalando Research, Shopify and OLX) which combines collaborative and content-based modeling techniques to learn input and latent representations of customers
and articles for size and fit prediction. For details please refer to [this](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1907.09844.pdf) article.
